-We're musicians and composers who have had a pretty traditional musical background
-When we came to Mills we were exposed to and became interested in the idea of performative live electronic music
-We didn't really know what that meant, so we spent a lot of time experimenting with different configurations of electronics and different interfaces
-Multi-media was always a component in our pieces.
-This included a lot of experiments with game art (We happen to really like games)
-Networking music, as it were, was a natural fit for what we were exploring. It provided an avenue for us to perform together live.
-We strong opinions about: musical interfaces, music concrete (as a performance medium), cogniziability (though we're not really our efforts work!)

-We formed a band with two other students, Ben O'Brien and Cole Ingraham called Glitch Lich
-It's been going strong ever since, and we still play to this day, though Ben has stopped performing with us.
-We've often performed scattered throughout the world (one performer in London, another in China, etc)
-This performance practice has affected some of our ideas on aesthetics in electronic music

Necronomicon

What motivated us to make Necronomicon:
-We wanted an environment that made making multi-media networked pieces easier to compose
-We wanted to create a custom audio engine that had the capabilities that we cared about (simple and effective busing and feedback systems, access to audio buffers from graphics land)
-We wanted a safer environment to construct pieces with. Network music is inherently a wild and unpredictable medium
-We wanted a less obtrusive syntax for expressing musical ideas



Random thoughts:
-We're less interested in the "distance" aspect of network music
-We've tended towards sound synthesis over sampling
-If you're interested in any of the same kinds of stuff, but baffled at where to begin with it, we recommend just coming up with ideas, experimenting, and learning as you go.

Advice for someone interested in this shit who's just getting started:
-Certainly, learn as much as you can during Chris's seminar
-Don't stop there, think of crazy ideas for pieces and try to make them work!
-If you don't know something you need to to make an idea work, learn it!
