Necronomicon
============

Necronomicon is a Haskell and C based Interactive Audio and Graphics Engine. The goal of the project is to provide an intuitive Functional Reactive environment that supports 3D graphics, audio synthesis, networking, and interactivity. Necronomicon takes inspiration from many projects including [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/), [Cinder](http://libcinder.org/), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), [Ogre](http://www.ogre3d.org/), and [Unity3d](http://unity3d.com/). It also builds upon our previous experience developing projects such as [OSCthulhu](https://github.com/CurtisMcKinney/OSCthulhu) and [Lich.js](https://github.com/ChadMcKinney/Lich.js).

Status
============

Necronomicon is currently under active development and we still consider it to be in an alpha stage. The API and libraries are undergoing rapid development and change, so any usage is discouraged until we've reached what we consider a more stable beta. At the moment the only supported platform is GNU/Linux, but more platforms including OSX, Windows, and possibly iOS and Android will be supported in the future.
